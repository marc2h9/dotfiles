## Installation Instructions
The best place for your dotfiles would be in the home directory
Please make sure you have all requirements before continuing

### Neovim
To install the neovim dotfiles you first have to follow the download instructions for Packer
After you have done that you must create a symbolic link using the following command:
```
ln -s path/to/dotfiles/nvim/ ~/.config/nvim
```
Once you have ran the command verify that the link does exist by going to the directory and running "ls -al"
Next you open up neovim and run this command to install the plugins
> [!important] 
> When running this for the first time it will throw a error
```
:PackerInstall
```

To fix the error that tree-sitter gives when installing you have to update with packer\
Once you have updated with packer your neovim setup is ready to go
```
:PackerUpdate
```

```
:Mason
```
You can then use "Ctrl + F" to filter between programming languages
to actually install the language you use the command
```
:LspInstall languagepacknamehere
```
or
```
:MasonInstall languagepacknamehere
```
### Updating LSP
To update your LSP packs you run the following command
```
:MasonUpdate
```
